# RestaurantRanker
Python algorithm, using Google Maps API, that ranks a query list of restaurants based on transit time, ratings, and other metrics.

I made this because my friends and I were deciding which Fried Chicken restaurant was the best in the Vancouver area. Obviously, the only way to decide is to try them all and vote as a group. But in what order should we try them? Well this is what this algorithm is for.
